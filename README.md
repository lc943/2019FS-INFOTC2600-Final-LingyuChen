## Digital Concept Tutorial
### Open Systems Interconnction Model (OSI Model)
#### Lingyu Chen, University of Missouri-Columbia, December.2019

> #### This tutorial will briefly introduce the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Model to students interested in computer networking. This tutorial is designed to give students a rough idea of the OSI Model about what it is and how it is layered.

**What it is**
> 	- The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) (Links to an external site.) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. 
>   - Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model had seven layers.
> -  - [Open Systems Interconnction Model (OSI Model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) (Wikipedia)

**What are seven layers**
>   1. Layer 1: Physical Layer
>   2. Layer 2: Data Link Layer
>   3. Layer 3: Network Layer
>   4. Layer 4: Transport Layer
>   5. Layer 5: Session Layer
>   6. Layer 6: Presentation Layer
>   7. Layer 7: Application Layer
