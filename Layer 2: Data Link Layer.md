# Layer 2: Data Link Layer
> - The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. 
> - When obtaining data from the Physical layer, the Data Link layer checks for physical transmission errors and packages bits into data "frames". The Data Link layer also manages physical addressing schemes such as MAC addresses for Ethernet networks, controlling access of any various network devices to the physical medium. Because the Data Link layer is the single most complex layer in the OSI model, it is often divided into two parts, the Media Access Control sub-layer and the Logical Link Control sub-layer.
